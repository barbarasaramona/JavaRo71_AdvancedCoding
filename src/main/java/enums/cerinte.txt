1) Create the TemperatureConvert enum class with constants C_F , C_K , K_C ,
F_C , F_K , K_F . Enum should adopt a constructor that includes three
parameters:
- input temperature unit
- output temperature unit
- the Converter interface instance (with a float convert(float tempIn)
method) - the instance should define the necessary calculations for temperature conversion

The TemperatureConvert enum class should adopt the static
convertTemperature method which will include the following params:
- input temperature unit
- output temperature unit
- value of the temperature
This method should return the converted value. To find the right constant from set of enum values,
use the values() method.

2) Crete an enum Weekday with constants MONDAY , TUESDAY , ... SUNDAY .
The enum should contain boolean isWeekDay and boolean isHoliday methods.

The isHoliday method should return the opposite result to the call of the isWeekDay method.
Please implement the whichIsGreater method as a scope of the enum class. This method should accept an object
of Weekday type. This method should display information that the indicated day of the week is the
predecessor or successor of the day of the week passed as the method argument.
Please consider using the compareTo method.

Present the solution described above with an example.
